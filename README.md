# Flutter App Bottom Navbar

I have created Flutter Bottom Navbar using Gnav Dependency
~(https://pub.dev/packages/google_nav_bar)

This is an Amazing Dependency, You can do the follows with built-in Gnav Methods.
1. Adding icon and can alse change its color and size.
2. Adding Label and can alse change its color and size.
3. Changing of Selected tab and selected background color.
4. Changing of tab size.
5. Changing Gap between icon and text inside tab.
6. Amazing Built-in Animations.
7. Perfectly automatic alignment on adding 3,4,5 tabs

I found this really helpful and the best part is that it proves modren Fresh UI design. Which boost your user experience with your app.
